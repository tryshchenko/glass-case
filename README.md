# Glass Case 🎁💰

Glass Case is a library which allows you to build your own *serverless* store in minutes.
It uses _google spreadsheet_ as a database and https://formspree.io/ as a contact form to process orders.

`This is PoC (Proof of Concept). It works, however some functionality needs to be implemented`

## Idea
When you start your e-commerce business - you don't wanna spend weeks working on your store. This products allow to roll out MVP in 15 minutes. It's the Angular 5 application and it doesn't require you to have any back-end. You can build it and publish anywhere.

## How To
- Create a google spreadsheet
- fill it with data
- make `publish -> csv`
- place that link in the configuration.
